\title{Year-wise Patient Count Data for Selected Codes}
\format{
A named list of 4 data frames. Each element corresponds to a code or to the full combined data.
}
\usage{
data("summary_stats_data_year")
}
\description{
A dataset showing patient count trends over time (by year) for selected medical codes including one PheCode and two RxNorm codes. 
Useful for generating line plots of patient trends across years.
}
\details{
Each entry in the list represents patient counts by year for a specific code. 
Each row in the data frames contains:
- **Year**: The 4-digit year (e.g., 2010, 2013).
- **Parent_Code**: The full ontology-prefixed code (e.g., `"PheCode:714.1"`, `"RXNORM:5487"`).
- **Patient_Count**: Number of unique patients who had at least one occurrence of the code in that year.
- **Name**: Truncated name or description of the code with code number (e.g., `"Rheumatoid arthritis (714.1)"`).

## Codes included:
- `"PheCode:714.1"`: Represents rheumatoid arthritis.
- `"RXNORM:5487"`: Represents a specific medication ingredient.
- `"RXNORM:6851"`: Another medication ingredient.
- `"combined"`: The merged data across all codes above for faceted plotting or full-line comparison.
